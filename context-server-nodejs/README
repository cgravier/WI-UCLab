# To run the server, node.js should be installed.
# The server :
#	- generates a regular interval of time new values for temperature et luminosity sensors.
# 	- keeps trace of the state of the shutters (closed by default).
#	- act as a bayeux-compliant message broker.

# You can run the server with the following command : 

node simulateArduino.js

# The server handle baveux requests on port 8000.
# A Q&D http server is attached to handle non-bayeux requests as follows (you can try those requests on your web browser)

http://localhost:8000/ 				: serves a JSON a current values simulated for temperature, luminosity, along the shutters state (closed or opened)

http://localhost:8000/shutters={closed,opened}	: modify server-side the shutters state accordingly http://localhost:8000/shutters=closed to close the shutters, http://localhost:8000/shutters=opened to open them.
